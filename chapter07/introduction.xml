<para>In this chapter we will install the bootscripts and set them up
properly. Most of these scripts will work without needing to modify them, but
a few require additional configuration files, since they deal with hardware
dependent information.</para>

<para>We have chosen to use System-V style init scripts simply because they
are widely used and we feel comfortable with them. If you would prefer to try
something else: Marc Heerdink has written a hint about BSD style init scripts,
to be found at <uri xlink:href="&hints-root;bsd-init.txt"/>. And if you'd like
something more radical, search the LFS mailing lists for <quote>depinit</quote>.
</para>

<para>If you decide to use some other style of init scripts, you can skip this
chapter and move on to <xref linkend="chapter-bootable"/>.</para>
