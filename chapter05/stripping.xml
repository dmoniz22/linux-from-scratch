  <title>Stripping</title>

  <para>The steps in this section are optional, but if the LFS partition is
  rather small, it is beneficial to learn that unnecessary items can be removed.
  The executables and libraries built so far contain about 130 MB of unneeded
  debugging symbols. Remove those symbols with:</para>

<screen><userinput>strip --strip-debug /tools/lib/*
strip --strip-unneeded /tools/{,s}bin/*</userinput></screen>

  <para>The last of the above commands will skip some twenty files,
  reporting that it does not recognize their file format. Most of these
  are scripts instead of binaries.</para>

  <para>Take care <emphasis>not</emphasis> to use
  <parameter>--strip-unneeded</parameter> on the libraries. The static
  ones would be destroyed and the toolchain packages would need to be
  built all over again.</para>

  <para>To save another 30 MB, remove the documentation:</para>

<screen><userinput>rm -rf /tools/{info,man}</userinput></screen>

  <para>There will now be at least 850 MB of free space on the LFS file
  system that can be used to build and install Glibc in the next phase.
  If you can build and install Glibc, you can build and install the rest
  too.</para>
