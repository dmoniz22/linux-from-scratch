<title>Installation of Coreutils</title>

<para>Prepare Coreutils for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION=199209 ./configure --prefix=/tools</userinput></screen>

<para>This package has an issue when compiled against versions of
Glibc later than 2.3.2. Some of the Coreutils utilities (such as
<command>head</command>, <command>tail</command>, and
<command>sort</command>) will reject their traditional syntax, a
syntax that has been in use for approximately 30 years. This old
syntax is so pervasive that compatibility should be preserved until
the many places where it is used can be updated. Backwards
compatibility is achieved by setting the
<envar>DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION</envar> environment variable to
<quote>199209</quote> in the above command. If you do not want
Coreutils to be backwards compatible with the traditional syntax, then
omit setting the <envar>DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION</envar>
environment variable. It is important to remember that doing so will
have consequences, including the need to patch the many packages that
still use the old syntax. Therefore, it is recommended that the
instructions be followed exactly as given above.</para>



<para>Compile the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>To test the results, issue: <userinput>make
RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes check</userinput>.  The
<parameter>RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes</parameter> parameter tells the
test suite to run several additional tests that are considered
relatively expensive (in terms of CPU power and memory usage) on some
platforms, but generally are not a problem on Linux.</para>

<para>Install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
