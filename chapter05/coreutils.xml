<title>Installation of Coreutils</title>

<para>Prepare Coreutils for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION=199209 ./configure --prefix=/tools</userinput></screen>

<para>This package has an issue when compiled against versions of glibc
later than 2.3.2.  Some of the Coreutils utilities (such as
<command>head</command>, <command>tail</command> and <command>sort</command>)
will reject their traditional syntax, a syntax that has been in use for
approximately 30 years. This old syntax is so pervasive that compatibility
should be preserved until the many places where it is used can be
updated.  Backwards compatibility is achieved by setting the
DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION environment variable to &quot;199209&quot; in the above
command.  If you don&apos;t want coreutils to be backwards compatible
with the traditional syntax, then simply omit setting the DEFAULT_POSIX2_VERSION
environment variable.  Realise though, that doing so will mean you&apos;ll have
to deal with the consequences yourself: patch the many packages that still use
the old syntax.  We therefore recommend using the instructions exactly as given
above.</para>

<para>Compile the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>(If you insist on testing the results, then issue:
<userinput>make RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes check</userinput>. The
<emphasis>RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes</emphasis> parameter tells the test suite to
run several additional tests that are considered relatively expensive on some
platforms but generally are not a problem on Linux.)</para>

<para>And install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
