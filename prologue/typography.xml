<para>To make things easier to follow, there are a few typographical
conventions used throughout the book. Following are some examples:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></screen>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is designed to be typed exactly 
as seen unless otherwise noted in the surrounding text. It is also used 
in the explanation sections to identify which of the commands is being 
referenced.</para></blockquote>

<screen><computeroutput>install-info: unknown option `--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'</computeroutput></screen>

<blockquote><para>This form of text (fixed width text) is showing screen 
output, probably as the result of commands issued, and is also used to 
show filenames, such as <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>.</para></blockquote>

<para><emphasis>Emphasis</emphasis></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used for several purposes in the 
book, mainly to emphasize important points or items.</para></blockquote>

<para><uri xlink:href="&lfs-root;">&lfs-root;</uri></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used for hyperlinks, both within the 
book and to external pages such as HOWTOs, download locations and
websites.</para></blockquote>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; $LFS/etc/group &lt;&lt; "EOF"
root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
......
EOF</userinput></screen>

<blockquote><para>This type of section is used mainly when creating 
configuration files. The first command tells the system to create 
the file <filename>$LFS/etc/group</filename> from whatever is typed on the following lines until 
the sequence EOF is encountered. Therefore, this whole section is generally 
typed as seen.</para></blockquote>

<para><replaceable>[REPLACED TEXT]</replaceable></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used to encapsulate text that is
not to be typed as seen or copy and pasted.</para></blockquote>
