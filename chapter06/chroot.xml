<info><title>Entering the chroot environment</title></info>
<?dbhtml filename="chroot.html"?>

<para>It is time to enter the chroot environment in order to begin building
and installing your final LFS system. Still as <emphasis>root</emphasis> run
the following command to enter the small world that is, at the moment,
populated with only the temporary tools:</para>

<screen><userinput>chroot "$LFS" /tools/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/tools/bin \
    /tools/bin/bash --login +h</userinput></screen>

<para>The <parameter>-i</parameter> option given to the
<command>env</command> command will clear all variables of the chroot
environment. After that, only the HOME, TERM, PS1 and PATH variables are
set again. The <parameter>TERM=$TERM</parameter> construct will set the TERM variable inside chroot
to the same value as outside chroot; this variable is needed for programs
like <command>vim</command> and <command>less</command> to operate
properly. If you need other variables present, such as CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS,
this is a good place to set them again.</para>

<para>From this point on there's no need to use the LFS variable anymore,
because everything you do will be restricted to the LFS file system -- since
what the shell thinks is <filename class="directory">/</filename> is actually
the value of <filename class="directory">$LFS</filename>, which was passed to
the chroot command.</para>

<para>Notice that <filename class="directory">/tools/bin</filename> comes
last in the PATH. This means that a temporary tool will not be used any more
as soon as its final version is installed. Well, at least when the shell
doesn't remember the locations of executed binaries -- for this reason hashing
is switched off by passing the <parameter>+h</parameter> option to
<command>bash</command>.</para>

<para>You have to make sure all the commands in the rest of this chapter and
in the following chapters are run from within the chroot environment.
If you ever leave this environment for any reason (rebooting for example),
you must remember to first mount the <systemitem class="filesystem">proc</systemitem>
and <systemitem class="filesystem">devpts</systemitem> file systems (discussed
in the previous section) <emphasis>and</emphasis> enter chroot again before
continuing with the installations.</para>

<para>Note that the <command>bash</command> prompt will say 
<computeroutput>I have no name!</computeroutput> This is
normal, as the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file has not been created yet.
</para>
