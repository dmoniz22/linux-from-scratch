<title>Cleaning Up</title>

<para>From now on, when reentering the chroot environment after
exiting, use the following modified chroot command:</para>

<screen><userinput>chroot "$LFS" /usr/bin/env -i \
    HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin \
    /bin/bash --login</userinput></screen>

<para>The reason for this is that, since the programs in <filename
class="directory">/tools</filename> are no longer needed, the
directory can be deleted to regain space. Before actually deleting the
directory, exit from chroot and reenter it with the above command.
Also, before removing <filename class="directory">/tools</filename>,
tar it up and store it in a safe place in case another LFS system will
be built.</para>

<note><para>Removing <filename class="directory">/tools</filename>
will also remove the temporary copies of Tcl, Expect, and DejaGNU
which were used for running the toolchain tests. To use these programs
later on, they will need to be recompiled and re-installed. The
installation instructions are the same as in <xref
linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/>, apart from changing the prefix
from <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> to <filename
class="directory">/usr</filename>. The BLFS book discusses a slightly
different approach to installing Tcl (see <ulink
url="&blfs-root;"/>).</para></note>

<para>The packages and patches stored in <filename
class="directory">/sources</filename> can also be moved to a more
usual location, such as <filename
class="directory">/usr/src/packages</filename>. The entire directory
can also be deleted if its contents have been burned to a CD.</para>
