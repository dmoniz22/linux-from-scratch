<title>How to ask for help</title>
<?dbhtml filename="askforhelp.html"?>

<para>If you run into a problem while working through this book, you should
first check the FAQ at <uri xlink:href="&faq-root;"/> -- often your question
is already answered there. If it is not, you should try to find the source of
the problem. The following hint might give you some ideas for your
troubleshooting: <uri xlink:href="&hints-root;errors.txt">&hints-root;errors.txt</uri>.</para>

<para>If all that fails, you will find that most people on IRC and the mailing
lists (see <xref linkend="ch-scatter-administrativa"/>) are willing to help
you. But to assist them in diagnosing and solving your problem, please include
all relevant information in your request for help.</para>

<section>
<title>Things to mention</title>
 
<para>Apart from a brief explanation of the problem you're having, the
essential things to include in your request are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the version of the book you are using (being &version;),</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the host distribution and version you are using to create
LFS,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the package or section giving you problems,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the exact error message or symptom you are receiving,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>whether you have deviated from the book at all.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<note><para>Saying that you've deviated from the book doesn't mean
that we won't help you. After all, LFS is about choice. It'll just
help us to see other possible causes of your problem.</para></note>

<title>Configure problems</title>

<para>When something goes wrong during the stage where the configure script
is run, look through the <filename>config.log</filename> file. This file
may contain errors encountered during configure which weren't printed to
the screen. Include those relevant lines if you decide to ask for
help.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Compile problems</title>

<para>To help us find the cause of the problem, both screen output and
the contents of various files are useful. The screen output from both
the ./configure script and the make run can be useful. Don't blindly
include the whole thing but, on the other hand, don't include too little.
As an example, here is some screen output from make:</para>

<screen><computeroutput>gcc -DALIASPATH=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale:.\"
-DLOCALEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale\" -DLIBDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/lib\"
-DINCLUDEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/include\" -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.
-g -O2 -c getopt1.c
gcc -g -O2 -static -o make ar.o arscan.o commands.o dir.o expand.o file.o
function.o getopt.o implicit.o job.o main.o misc.o read.o remake.o rule.o
signame.o variable.o vpath.o default.o remote-stub.o version.o opt1.o
-lutil job.o: In function `load_too_high':
/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1/job.c:1565: undefined reference to `getloadavg'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [make] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2</computeroutput></screen>

<para>In this case, many people just include the bottom section where it
says:</para>

<screen><computeroutput>make [2]: *** [make] Error 1</computeroutput></screen>

<para>and onwards. This isn't enough for us to diagnose the problem because it
only tells us that <emphasis>something</emphasis> went wrong, not
<emphasis>what</emphasis> went wrong. The whole section, as in the example
above, is what should be included to be helpful, because it includes the
command that was executed and the command's error message(s).</para>

<para>An excellent article on asking for help on the Internet in general
has been written by Eric S. Raymond. It is available online at 
<uri xlink:href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"</uri>.
Read and follow the hints in that document and you are much more likely
to get a response to start with and also to get the help you actually
need.</para>

<title>Test suite problems</title>

<para>Many packages provide a test suite which, depending on the importance
of the package, we may encourage you to run. Sometimes packages will
generate false or expected failures. If you encounter these, you can check
the LFS Wiki page at <uri xlink:href="&wiki-root;">&wiki-root;</uri> to see
whether we have already noted and investigated them. If we already know about
them, then usually there is no need to be concerned.</para>
