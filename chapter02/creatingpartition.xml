<para>In order to build a new Linux system, space is required in the
form of an empty disk partition. If the computer does not have a free
partition or room on any of the hard disks to make one, LFS can be
built on the same partition where the current distribution is
installed.</para>

<note><para>This advanced procedure is not recommended
for your first LFS installation, but if you are short on
disk space the following document can be helpful: <ulink

<para>A minimal system requires a partition of around 1.3 gigabytes
(GB).  This is enough to store all the source tarballs and compile 
the packages. However, if the LFS system is intended to be the primary
Linux system, additional software will probably be installed which
will require additional space (2 or 3 GB). The LFS system itself will
not take up this much space. A large portion of this required amount
of space is to provide sufficient free temporary space. Compiling
packages can require a lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after
the package is installed.</para>

<para>Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM)
available for compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small
disk partition as swap space.  This space is used by the kernel to
store seldom-used data to make room in memory for active processes.
The swap partition for an LFS system can be the same as the one used
by the host system, so another swap partition will not need to be
created if your host system already has one setup.</para>

<para>Start a disk partitioning program such as
<command>cfdisk</command> or <command>fdisk</command> with a command
line option naming the hard disk on which the new partition will be
created&mdash;for example <filename class="devicefile">/dev/hda</filename> for
the primary Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) disk. Create a Linux native
partition and a swap partition, if needed. Please refer to the man
pages of <command>cfdisk</command> or <command>fdisk</command> if you
do not yet know how to use the programs.</para>

<para>Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g.,
<filename class="devicefile">hda5</filename>). This book will refer to this as the LFS
partition. Also remember the designation of the swap partition. These
names will be needed later for the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>
file.</para>

<para arch="raq2">On a Cobalt RaQ2/Cube2 we use the existing firmware for a boot loader,
it requires an ext2 revision 0 partition to boot from. So here is the
recommended partition for a Cobalt RaQ2/Cube2 system:</para>

<itemizedlist arch="raq2">
<listitem><para>The first partition should be 50-100 MB.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The second partition should be all the remaining space minus the
amount of RAM in the system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The third partition is going to be your swap partition, which will
be the same amount as the RAM installed in the system.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
