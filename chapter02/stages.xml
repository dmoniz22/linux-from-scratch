  <title>Building LFS in Stages</title>

  <para>LFS is designed to be built in one session.  That is, the
  instructions assume that the system will not be shut down
  during the process.  This does not mean that the system has to
  be built in one sitting.  The issue is that certain procedures
  must be repeated after a reboot when resuming LFS at
  different points.</para>

    <para>These chapters run commands on the host system.  When

        A <command>su - lfs</command> command must be issued before performing any task in these
        chapters. If you don't do that, you are at risk of installing packages to the
