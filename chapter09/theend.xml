<para>Well done! You have finished installing your LFS system. It may have

<para>It may be a good idea to create an <filename>/etc/lfs-release</filename>
file. By having this file it is very easy for you (and for us if you are going
to ask for help with something at some point) to find out which LFS version
you have installed on your system. Create this file by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo &version; &gt; /etc/lfs-release</userinput></screen>
